Mellanox SAI implementation release notes
==========================================

Release 1.0.0
---------------

Current implementation is partial. 

Some aspects aren't yet fully defined in SAI API v0.9.0 itself, such as full init flow and port mapping. Therefore it is needed, as a precondition, to run dvs_start.sh, to initialize the SDK and the switch.

In addition, not all the APIs that are defined were fully implemented in this release. Missing flows or implementation are noted in the code as "TODO : ..." comments.
There is no implementation currently for route, neighbor and next hop functionality.

The code was tested to work on X86, at Alpha level.
No testing was done on PPC.
The code compiles with, and was tested with, SDK version 4.1.5000
